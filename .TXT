DEVOPS 

devops = development + operations 
. developers (who write code) 
. operations (who deploy/manage system) 
work together, instead of working in silos.

real time example :  imagine developing a mobile app like swiggy.
1. the developer writes code to add "track my order" feature.
2. without devops: developer gives code to ops team --- they manually deploy --- bugs happen --- delay.
3. with devops: code is automatically tested and deployed -- customers get update faster and safely.

devops helps :
1. release features faster.
2. fix bugs quickly.
3. automate repetitive tasks.
